- What happend when we add second file on GITHUB

#git status

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        Git-Bookscript2.txt

#git add . // add all files

#git diff //compare versions

#delete files 
$ git rm filedelete1.txt


# rename files
git mv firstfiletxt secondfile.txt

------------------------------------------------
Lets imagine we have folder with website files
 
And we need make changes about contact number, so 
we go the file and we changed numbers

if we do :

#git diff contact.html // we can check the changes that were made

#git commit -am " make changes index and commit"
