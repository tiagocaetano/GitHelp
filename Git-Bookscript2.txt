- What happend when we add second file on GITHUB

#git status

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        Git-Bookscript2.txt

#git add . // add all files

#git diff //compare versions

#delete files 
$ git rm filedelete1.txt


# rename files
git mv firstfiletxt secondfile.txt

------------------------------------------------
Lets imagine we have folder with website files
 
And we need make changes about contact number, so 
we go the file and we changed numbers

if we do :

#git diff contact.html // we can check the changes that were made

#git commit -am " make changes index and commit"

------------------------------------------------
#git add example/ //aplly all subfolders
  

Best pratice 

1- if we do for example 2 changes 
# git commit - m "first change"
# git commit -am "second change and apply all"
 
----------------------------------------
Ignore files GitHub

project/.gitignore
-very basic regular expressions 
*? [aeiou] [0-9]  
-negative expressions with 
*.php
!index.php


sources:
https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files

----------------------------------------
Branches 
-Try new ideas
-isolate features or sections of work
-One working directory 


we have project 

master-> ce32 ->534de
8c45 	revise_nvigation (will work?)

so we create new branch 
# git branch newfeature // we can check in the Header file
# ls -la .git/refs/heads // check the brench in the project
// the branch still apoints to the master-

# git checout newfeature
#Switched to branch 'newfeature'
// at this point, the master is new feature
